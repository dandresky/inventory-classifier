# Tools  

Initially I am starting with the Keras Deep Learning library with the TensorFlow backend and will train on the cifar-10 image dataset to evaluate capabilities and learn the nuances of the framework.

# Pretraining

Deep Belief Networks consist of one or more RBN layers to prelearn higher order features. The weights are used to initialize weights of a parallel feed-forward network.  

One experiment to run is to build a series of these RBN's to visualize their output and possible contribution to the overall solution.
