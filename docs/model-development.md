# Pretraining

Deep Belief Networks consist of one or more RBN layers to prelearn higher order features. The weights are used to initialize weights of a parallel feed-forward network.  

One experiment to run is to build a series of these RBN's to visualize their output and possible contribution to the overall solution.
